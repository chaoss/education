## CHAOSS Education Working Group

The CHAOSS Education Working Group was formed to address the need for broader engagement for contributors and to have a central place for follow-up.
<br>
***Objectives:***
- To ensure consistent interaction, guidance, and review with contributors throughout the three-step process necessary to produce high-quality videos.
- To develop and maintain comprehensive open source educational resources.
- To provide support for each contributor in a more collaborative environment.
- To explore and implement innovative formats for educational content delivery eg Infographics and Visual Summaries, Workshops materials etc.
- To continuously improve the course creation process based on contributor feedback, lessons learned, and evolving best practices in educational content development.

The working group meeting is on [CHAOSS calendar](https://chaoss.community/chaoss-calendar/).
We strongly believe that much of what makes open source so great is the incredible communities it brings together, so we invite you to join us at [CHAOSS Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/chaoss-workspace/shared_invite/zt-28p56bayt-67TRjdA4yJWQmUd4hCzULg) and the #education channel.
